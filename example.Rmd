Loading the Data
----------------------
The `Chill Coma Recovery Time`-Measurements are saved in the file 
`ccrt.txt`. We load it using

```{r}
ccrt <- read.table("~/Downloads/datasets/ccrt.txt", header=TRUE, quote="\"")
head(ccrt)
str(ccrt)
```

Visiual Instpection
----------------------
First, lets have a look at the distribution of the data:
```{r}
hist(subset(ccrt, population == 'BKK')$ccrt)
hist(subset(ccrt, population == 'KATH')$ccrt)
```

For the `KATH` population there seem to be some outliers. Does not look very 
normal. Let's try stick to non-parametric tests.

Testing for difference
----------------------
```{r}
wilcox.test(subset(ccrt, population == 'BKK')$ccrt, 
            subset(ccrt, population == 'KATH')$ccrt)
```
Seems to be significant!
